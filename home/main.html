    <p>Thanks for coming to my personal website! I don't have much here at the moment, but you can feel free to poke
        around, of
        course. I'm in the process of finding out what I want this site to be. Feel free to check back later to see if
        anything changes!</p>
    <p>Here are some javascript games I've made, so you don't get too bored:</p>

                you can!</i>
        </li>
        <li><a href="../old-js-games/2d-raymarcher/">Raymarching demo</a><br><i>Can you solve the
