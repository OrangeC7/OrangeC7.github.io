    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I like to program things every once in a while, like this website, or those javascript demos on the homepage. I
        also like to poke around in networking and
        learn how computers talk to each other.</p>
    <p>On a slightly different note, I also enjoy the small details in things. UI design is just one example where all
        the small details matter, and I love it.</p>
