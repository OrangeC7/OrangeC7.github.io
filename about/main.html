    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm a red panda that's rhythm game obssessed, Japan enthused, and a nerd on the internet.</p>
    <p>I like to program things every once in a while, like this website! I also like to poke around in networking and
        learn how computers talk to each other. When I'm not feeling like being lazy and sitting around all day, I might
        even try to do something fancy with a raspberry pi.</p>
    <p>On a slightly different note, I also enjoy the small details in things. UI design is just one example where all
        the small details matter, and I love it.</p>
